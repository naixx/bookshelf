Book discovery application ðŸ“š
-----------------------------

Assignment
----------

**Write a Android application for book discovery using an API that we provide**

-   User must be able to create an account and log in.

-   User must be able to discover and search for books

-   Functional UI/UX design is needed. You are not required to create a unique design, however, do follow best practices to make the project as functional as possible.

-   After user initially logging in, he must not login again as he already received a token

-   You can take inspiration from this Bookshelf app [https://bookshelf.lol](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bookshelf.lol/&source=gmail-html&ust=1636788504815000&usg=AOvVaw0BS_1VqdbRdiYXI6l9noRf) (especially the discover page)

-   When the app is loaded, a background task/process needs to be started, that monitors the user's clicks/touches grouped by each component or screen

**Technical requirements:**

1.  Works on Android --- we need an APK

1.  SignUp/Login screen - where user can login/register

1.  Books screen - Where books from the api are displayed. The screen should have a search bar at the top where when user types results of his query should be displayed. *Hint:* Use the `/books?q=".."` api call While results are loading, the user should see a loading indicator

1.  Individual book screen. When the user taps on a book, he gets taken to an individual book screen where he can read the full synopsis of the book

**Nice to have:**
-----------------

-   Clean code. Write as if somebody will look over your code (because somebody will)

-   Kotlin

Evaluation
----------

We look for:

1.  The way you structure your test code and how you write it

1.  Your train of thought

1.  Your testing skills

1.  Your decision-making

1.  Attention to details

**Submission:**
---------------

Provide a public GitHub repo with the project. Provide a [readme.md](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://readme.md&source=gmail-html&ust=1636788504815000&usg=AOvVaw0wlATjTGP3FG_ZC5n8LvFD) on how to build locally and also provide the final APK.

Deadline
--------

It has to be submitted within 24hours since the moment you received this assignment.

### Books

**IMPORTANT!:** These API calls are protected and to access them, you need to obtain a token from either the **login** or **register** api calls and give your request an authentication header like so:

```
headers: {
                          // token obtained from register/login
 'Authorization': 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVjYmJjMmM4LWU0M2UtNGVkYi1hZmQ5LWYwYzk2ZjY4MGQxNCIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdDIiLCJpYXQiOjE2MTcyMDY1MDEsImV4cCI6MTYyMjM5MDUwMX0.RAheTgvk3G54HpDirl2VPKB_KemAwG2P6I8Z5au-0D0'
}
```

-   **Get books**. `GET {{API_URL}}/books`

    If called as is, the api call will return 10 random books

    This api call can be passed `q` as a way to filter books.

    Example: `GET {{API_URL}/books?q=harry` â‡’ Will most likely result in Harry Potter books

    Response:
